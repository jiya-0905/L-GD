# L-GD
Our Library Management System is designed to streamline and automate the processes involved in managing
a library. Built using PL/SQL, the system provides robust functionality for issuing and returning books,
managing fines for overdue returns, and facilitating the booking of Group Discussion (GD) rooms. This
system aims to enhance the efficiency of library operations while ensuring an optimal experience for both
librarians and library users.
The library management system offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to streamline book issuance
and returns, fine management, GD (Group Discussion) room booking, reporting, and analytics, all within
a user-friendly interface. Users can issue books with ease by providing their credentials and book details.
The system manages due dates and sends automated reminders for overdue books, helping users avoid fines.
Upon return, books are checked in, availability is updated, and any associated fines are cleared. The fine
management system calculates fines for overdue books according to predefined rules, ensuring consistency
and transparency. Users are informed about fines through their accounts and can view fine details.
The system also facilitates group collaboration by allowing users to book GD rooms. Room availability
is displayed in real-time, enabling users to choose appropriate time slots. Reporting and analytics functionalities
provide insights into library operations, with customizable reports on book issuance, returns,
fines collected, and room bookings. These analytics features help identify trends, track popular books, and
optimize library resources.
